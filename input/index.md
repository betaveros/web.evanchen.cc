This is the homepage of Evan Chen (陳誼廷),
known also as `vEnhance` on many websites.
I'm an [MIT grad student](https://math.mit.edu/directory/profile.php?pid=2106)
under [Wei Zhang](https://math.mit.edu/~wz2113/),
and also a math olympiad coach on the side.

My CV is [here](upload/public-CV.pdf).
Here is a [list of my major coursework](upload/math-coursework.pdf)
from undergraduate and graduate school.
These days, I'm interested in number theory and combinatorics.
My papers are linked on my [publications page](publications.html),
and also on the [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/a/chen_e_2.html).

I am on [GitHub](https://github.com/vEnhance/),
[Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/evanchen.cc/),
[Twitch](https://twitch.tv/vEnhance),
and [WordPress](https://blog.evanchen.cc).
You can also see my [personal page](personal.html) for trivia about myself.

If you are a high school student interested in math olympiads,
you should visit the [beginner's page](wherestart.html),
my [collection of handouts](olympiad.html),
or my [archive of past problems and solutions](problems.html).

In addition to serving as the team selection coordinator for the United States,
Evan runs his own [training program](otis.html) while
[streaming olympiad math for public entertainment](videos.html).

As a high school student, Evan was an
IMO gold medalist
and a winner of the 2014 USA math olympiad,
which he took from 12:30am to 5am in Taiwan.
He also wrote the popular textbook
[Euclidean Geometry in Math Olympiads](geombook.html) while in high school,
which was published in 2016.

Outside of math and teaching, Evan's hobbies include
Korean pop dance, [Arch Linux, Hanabi and puzzle hunts](personal.html).
