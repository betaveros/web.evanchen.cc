### {{ hl("about", "About") }}

*The OTIS Excerpts* is a mini-book
that I put together from
[lecture notes I use during the year](otis.html).
It is a collection of 192 problems and solutions.
It is designed to mostly be beginner-friendly
though some of the chapters are more challenging.

There is also a [user-created forum][forum]
for discussing the examples and problems from the text.

### Contents

The Excerpts consist of selected problems from the following
twelve topics from the [OTIS catalog][catalog]:

+ Standard inequalities
+ Functional equations
+ Monsters
+ Global
+ Local
+ Rigid
+ Free
+ Anti-problems
+ Orders
+ Prime exponents
+ Heavy number theory (called "advanced techniques")
+ Constructions in Number Theory

Most of the lecture material is adapted from
[existing handouts of mine](olympiad.html)
but some of it is new.
In addition, there is a chapter for beginners in proof-writing,
and three chapters consisting of selected problems
and solutions to recent USA team selection test problems.

Geometry is not covered;
[there is already a textbook for that](geombook.html).

### Source

The source code is sludge,
but if you really want it [here's a ZIP](textbooks/OTIS-Excerpts.src.zip).
Much of the underlying TeX is actually machine generated
(by interactions with my problem database),
so don't learn any habits from it.
