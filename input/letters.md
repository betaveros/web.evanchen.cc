---

Sometimes high school students ask me for reference letters.
(Some of them even got in!)
So here are some details.

## {{ hl("programs", "Programs I can write for") }}

I write letters most commonly for
[RSI](https://www.cee.org/research-science-institute)
and typical undergraduate colleges (MIT and Common App).
For the latter, most people prefer to invite me as a supplemental letter
rather than as a math teacher proper.
I can also write letters for
[PRIMES](https://math.mit.edu/research/highschool/primes/index.html),
although I am of the impression that the awards and entrance exam
hold much more weight than rec letters for PRIMES (compared to, say, college apps).

I've also written letters for summer math camps
such as Canada/USA MathCamp, PROMYS/ROSS, etc.

## {{ hl("ask", "Whether to ask") }}

You should only ask for a letter from me if I know you somewhat well.[^obvious]

[^obvious]: This may sound obvious, but I get requests from total strangers...

Letters from me will necessarily be a bit unusual,
so you should think about whether I'm the right person to do this.
Here are a few reasons why:

- I am not formally a teacher or professor,
  which may confuse any clueless admissions officers[^fancy].
- Also, if I only worked with you at
  [MOP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_Olympiad_Program)
  or [OTIS](otis.html), I may not have spent enough time
  with you in-person to "paint a picture"
  compared to a teacher at your school, so to speak.
- You are going to be compared to other OTIS/MOP students.
  This is not to say the comparison will necessarily be unfavorable.
  However, the letter is probably not going to say you are the
  strongest student I've ever met, either, whereas many of you _are_
  the best student your local high school has ever seen.

[^fancy]: Although I am gradually picking up increasingly fancy titles.

Usually people will ask me for letters if they want to add
some context about their math contest experiences that's more than just score,
or to have me advocate for their mathematical ability.
I try to also, when I have enough data, say a bit about what you're like
as a person when interacting with me or other OTIS students.

Since I'm a nice person,
I promise to not intentionally write a negative letter.[^regret]
If I feel I cannot write you a letter with nonnegative value,
I will decline your request instead.[^support]

[^regret]:
    Regrettably, I speak from experience here.
    When applying to graduate school and fellowships, a sympathetic person
    tipped me off that one of my letters was "not doing me any favors" and
    warned me to delete it from my graduate school applications if possible.
    I am still grateful to him today since I would likely not have been
    admitted to MIT's math PhD program otherwise. (Alas, this tip was
    [too late for all the other schools](/static/grad-school-decisions.png),
    as I had already finalized my application at that point.)

[^support]:
    This is because I believe a good mentor should be
    unconditionally supportive, much like a parent,
    and that it's not my place to judge students.

## {{ hl("instructions", "Instructions") }}

If you do ask a letter for me, I need the following information.

1. Ideally, ask at least a month in advance.
   (If it's less than one month, you can still ask, but I may decline.)
2. Please remind me which years I worked with you (in OTIS/MOP/SPARC/etc.).
   I have been doing this for so long that the years are all mixed
   up in my head, so I'd like to double-check!
3. Provide any recent math olympiad results,
   like USAMO / TSTST / TST / IMO.
   (I may not use them, but I want to have them if I need them).
4. Is there anything in particular I should discuss?
   In particular, how math-focused do you want me to be?
5. Please **send me any application essays or completed forms**
   you are willing to share (drafts of essays are okay).
   This way, I can tailor my letter to complement
   what you've already written.
6. State explicitly when the deadline is.
7. Specify what "type" of letter I am writing, if applicable.
   For example, colleges commonly distinguish between, say
   "required" letters from a math teacher, or optional "supplements"
   (see e.g. [MIT][mitsupp], second-to-last paragraph).
   It is useful for me to know whether I am the main voice or if
   I am expecting to add on to what other (usually more traditional)
   teachers have to say.
8. Specify which email address you applied to the program with.

Usually, I will always submit letters
at least a week in advance if you asked ahead of time.
So if it's less than a week until the deadline and the letter I promised
hasn't been submitted yet, then please double-check on it.
