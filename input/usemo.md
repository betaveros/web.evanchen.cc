The **US Ersatz Math Olympiad** is a proof-based
competition open to all US middle and high school students.
Like many competitions, its goals are to
develop interest and ability in mathematics (rather than measure it).
However, it is one of few
proof-based contests **open to all US middle and high school students**.

The USEMO is hosted on the
[Art of Problem Solving website][aops-usemo].
This contest is *not* sponsored
by the Math Association of America
(which runs the [USAMO][usamo]).

The difficulty of the contest is intended to be similar to [IMO][imo].
As part of the learning experience,
we aim to **provide feedback (rather than just score)** to participants.
You can read the [full USEMO mission statement][mission]
to get a better sense for the goals of the competition.

The USEMO is largely run on an honor system, although we may offer prizes.
Please check the [full rules and procedures][rules].

# {{ hl("volunteer", "Volunteer") }}

Volunteering is open to anyone who is not themselves eligible to compete.
The two biggest things we can use help with are:

- **Grading**: this is by far the main bottleneck.
	If you have any capability to read through some submissions, please help!
	While you need experience reading mathematical proofs
	to fulfill this role, you do NOT need past competition experience.
	We will provide marking schemes,
	and pair up experienced graders with newer ones.
	You can read [more info about the grading here][grading-info];
	see also the [advice for problem captains][captain].
	<br>
	To sign up for grading,
	[fill out this 2022 form](https://forms.gle/qKDptQ2GTpgCPrCN6).

- **Problem proposals**: we welcome proposals for problems
	from anyone who is not eligible for the contest.
	See the [problem proposal guidelines][propose].
	For USEMO 2022, the deadline for submissions is **September 10, 2022**.

Please contact the directors for details on these,
or if you have other ideas on how you could help out.
