These are some handouts I've written over the years.
The [Math](https://blog.evanchen.cc/category/mathematics/) and
[Problem-Solving](https://blog.evanchen.cc/category/problem-solving/) sections
of my personal blog might also be of interest.
See also [Recommendations](recommend.html) for other authors I like,
and my [geometry book](geombook.html) for a
comprehensive textbook in Euclidean geometry.
See also [Problems](problems.html) for contest papers.

**LaTeX notes**:
I provided the LaTeX source for most of these files as an example here.
But note to compile these documents in LaTeX, you will need
[my personal style file evan.sty][evan.sty].
Because this style file evolves over time,
your output might look a little different from the PDF's attached here.

## {{ hl("beginners", "Beginners") }}

I suggest reading through the [beginner's page](wherestart.html) first.

## {{ hl("general", "General") }}

	This is a description of the conditions necessary to
	execute a Lagrange Multipliers solution on an olympiad.

* <b>Olympiad Inequalities</b> {{ handout_link("Ineq", "en") }}
	English translation of my original notes in Chinese.
	Describes some "standard strategies" for handling olympiad inequalities. <br>
	Original Chinese version: {{ handout_link("Ineq") }}

* <b>SOS: A Dumbass's Perspective</b> {{ handout_link("SOS_Dumbass") }}
	Describes the SOS method for solving inequalities.

## {{ hl("combo", "Combinatorics (Gryffindor)") }}

* <b>Expected Uses of Probability</b> {{ handout_link("ProbabilisticMethod") }}
	Inspired by Po-Shen Loh's talk at the 55th IMO 2014 or Problem 6.
	Talks about expected value and the probabilistic method.
	This article was included in
	[Mathematical Reflections, Issue 6 of 2014](https://www.awesomemath.org/wp-pdf-files/math-reflections/mr-2014-06/probabilistic.pdf).

## {{ hl("geo", "Geometry (Slytherin)") }}

* <b>A Guessing Game: Mixtilinear Incircles</b>
	{{ handout_link("Mixt-GeoGuessr") }}
	A quick description of some nice properties of mixtilinear incircles.
	Presented as a "guessing game" where one has to guess collinear points,
	cyclic quadrilaterals, and so on beforehand.

* <b>Barycentric Coordinates in Olympiad Geometry</b>
	[(full)](handouts/bary/bary-full.pdf)
	[(abridged)](handouts/bary/bary-short.pdf) <br>
	One of my most famous handouts from 2012.
	Introduces from scratch the method of barycentric coordinates.
	This was the basis of chapter 7 of [my geometry textbook](geombook.html).

* <b>Bashing Geometry with Complex Numbers</b>

	A handout on advice for drawing diagrams on geometry problems.

* <b>How to Use Directed Angles</b>
	{{ handout_link("Directed-Angles") }}
	A short note on the use of directed angles in olympiad solutions.
